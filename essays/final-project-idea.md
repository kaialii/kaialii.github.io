#          Overview
###    The Problem

Students often have a hard time understanding which classes transfer to which in-house institution within the UH System. Let alone, understand the articuation agreements between these schools that help bridge students from 2 year to 4 year, or graduate and above degree programs. There is also the fact that these schools actually have different tuition rates per credit/fees, etc. Another determining factor is the reviews of professors and courses/classes from prior students which could be taken into account when looking at taking instruction from particular sections.  

  

###    The Solution

Use dataset from UH system class availability, articulation agreements, course transfer database, degrees/programs, online distance learning courses, UH course survey, and the out of network rate my proffessor website to help piece together a one stop shop for helping students better comprehend the full picture when making decisions of which professors, courses to take based on class information/surveys, and rate my professor/surveys. Also, keeping in mind the portrayal of articulation agreements, and tuition costs.
