#	Jsfiddle Euler Roof

##	jsfiddle

	###	jsfiddle is an online development environment that can be used to write programing 
	syntax such as JavaScript. The jsfiddle portal can also be used to code and run code to 
	see results sent to the console without needing to download anything on the user’s 
	personal command prompt, or terminal application on their operating system of choice. 
	Downloading necessary tools prior to practicing incremental development on a computer, 
	enables a more friendly way of learning to apply coding languages like javascript. 

##	ProjectEulerOne
	###	ProjectEulerOne was a website that provided a question to ponder and find a solution 
	to after having reviewed a javascript style guide explaining the correct usage of 
	objects in javascript. Problem 1 from Multiples of 3 and 5 in the archives of 
	ProjectEuler.net gave us our first problem in need of a solution  via javascript: 
	

##	WOD
	###	In this workout of the day, regarding the pedagogy of the athletic software engineering 
	aspect of this course, we were reintroduced to the functionalities for referencing, such 
	as “const” and “let”, in lieu of previously used “var” definitions.     

#	Sample Code in JavaScript
```ruby
function projectEulerOne(maxLimit) {
	let sum = 0;
	for (let i = 0; i < maxLimit; i++) {
  	if (((i % 3) === 0) || ((i % 5) === 0)) {
    	sum += i;
    }
  }
  return sum;
}
console.log(projectEulerOne(1000));
```

##	Noob mistakes	     
	###	After having gone through some of the preliminary training from CodecAcademy and
	FreeCodeCamp related to JavaScript writing, the lessons learned were very useful and 
	yet in practice hard to replicate within the timed sessions that were incorporated for 
	introducing quick reaction of submitting viable code in a timely manner to promote 
	application of learning, and comprehension of subject matter. 

##	Timed sessions of coding solution for beginners
