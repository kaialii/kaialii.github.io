#           Codecology
##          Coderectness
###    Rules are rules
Following a template of coding in terms of <a href=”https://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314s22/morea/coding-standards/reading-javascript-coding-standards.html”>"Javascript Coding Standards"</a> of which other coders could amend, or pickup and continue is crucial to immediately understanding and contributing in teams or group settings for collaboration of compiling a project with fellow co-workers or enthusiasts. 

###    Quality Control
So far, the implementation of ESLint for showing user problems/mistakes came in handy as it seems to be like a spellcheck method of checking our code and helps us to further proof-read our code according to baseline JavaScript coding standards. The Professor has also mentioned in class that it is possible to add some words for approval to be honored by ESLint/the coding standard if, there are errors that need to explicitly be avoided to progress through the error checking phase of programing. 

###    Jammerly
The green checkmark feature inherent in IntelliJ is intuitive and enables the user to more easily understand the errors that mimics the way google chrome developer tools would pose to the user to display errors/issues. Npm can be installed and ran via console/terminal of IntelliJ or the workstations command prompt or terminal depending on the operating system that is being using. Npm enables lint to check JavaScript straight from the command line without the use of any integrated development environment. With editor, scheme, inspections options provided for setup for projects, I could ensure that whatever code I typed could be checked for adherence to formality and correctness from errors, or at least prompt the solution in some cases, or even better direct the user to pick up the idea of the issue to more effectively resolve the issues. 

##    Shortcomings with settings

I realized that working with IntelliJ to incorporate ESLint/coding standards became a burden initially due to configuring the settings every time I had started a new project. However, after mentioning the issue with Branden the teacher’s assistant, Branden was able to explain to me how to configure the preferences/settings to somewhat remember the configurations of which I would always like to work on future projects with, which made my journey for constructing my environment to conduct coding business a little faster and easier than I could do manually, when pressed for time to setup other configurations on github, github desktop, laulima, etc.

##    Bottomline

Realizing the power of ESLint and general coding standards set forth by JavaScript to keep coders in line with the same or very similar guidelines of writing program language is essential to help coders new to the code read and understand someone else’s code in conjunction with the pseudo/algorithm code.
