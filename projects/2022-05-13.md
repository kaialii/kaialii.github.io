Carpool and Go! is a web application project mockup that aims to provide a communal network for University of Hawaii at Manoa, allowing for drivers to offer rides and for riders to be able to search for rides in their area.

During this group project I was able to setup the foundation of the fast ride form/request, and its corresponding pages and components. Understanding how the form would populate information into the database and be subject for review or in other words viewing for all accounts/users on the fast ride request page was conceptually practiced by the digits experience assignment, where we learned how to capture information input by the user and send that info directly to another page for viewing and cataloging. This task seemed a little difficult at first as we needed to use bowfolios and digits as templates to fork or branch off of to bring over to our project the main basics from previous work to start from. 

### "Fast Ride" Feed
The "Fast Ride" feed page will be a feed that consists of all of the requested Fast rides sent by the Fast Ride Form. The feed will display the user's Profile Picture, their first and last name, their current and desired locations, the time they need a ride, a brief description of their requested ride, and their contact information. Other users can then contact the user or click on their profile to get more information about that specific user.

### "Fast Ride" Request
The "Fast Ride" request page is a form that allows a user to request a ride to a specific location at a particular time of day. It allows the user to input their current and desired locations, their time of ride, and a description of why they need the ride. It will send data to the "Fast Ride" feed.

I was also able to working on the development of the deletion of accounts users, on the admin overview page, which is accessible when logged in with admin privileges. 

I was also able to link the same page to reload when the deletion aspect of the admin overview page was selected by an admin to remove users and accounts. However, we had also decided to incorporate a confirm prompt to ask the user if they were certain they wish to continue with the deletion of information selected from the database, which led to issues mainly related to the modules.js external resource file reloading to the identified loading page to “/” when the functioning the component of the confirmation. We ended up being unable to fix this little bug and abandoned the feature towards the end of the project due to time constraints, as this was more of a beyond the basics type of characteristic we added to our milestone 3 on the latter half of the project, as it seemed feasible at the time of thinking.
